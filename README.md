## :book: What I learned

- How to display map with [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- How to change the map center in React Leaflet

  - Create a React Component

    ```
    const SetViewOnRefresh = ({ coords }) => {
      const map = useMap()
      map.setView(coords, map.getZoom())

      return null
    }
    ```

  - Call the Component inside MapContainer with new latitude and longitude
    ```
    <SetViewOnRefresh coords={[lat, lng]} />
    ```

### :house: Development

- Make map interactive
- Add error message for incorrect IP Addresses and domains
